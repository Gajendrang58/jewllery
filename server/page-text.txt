                                        Recently, there has been constant soar in the demand for gold in Chennai. Though it sounds weird at a time of pandemic as the COVID-19, this holds true as per data and reports. And that too in particular, people are eyeing on jewelries more than gold in its bullion form.
                                        Do you know what bullions are? Bullions are unprocessed forms of gold or silver that are usually available as coins or bars.
                                        And at this juncture, it becomes imperative for one to learn the gold rate in Chennai, because as aforementioned, you don't want gold in its purest 24 Karats form rather want it in 22 Karats. This obviously invites the need for checking gold rates in Chennai more often.

                                        Choose between 22 Karats and 24 Karats
                                        There is often a misconception that gold has to be purchased in its 24 Karat form only as it is the purest. Well, practically, it doesn't work that way as your gold jewelries can't depend solely on the yellow metal, but comes with a mix of other metals like copper in the 22 Karat form.

                                         24 Karat gold?
                                        To put it in simple words, this form of gold has all its 24 parts made of gold without the use or trace of any other metal. The purity of this form of gold is said to be 99.9 percent and hence gold bullions of 24 Karat are deep yellow in shade. 
                                        This is notably the superior formof gold globally. Well, it is imperative to comprehend with this fact as there are bogus sales boasting of 25K or 26K gold as well. Gold in this form is of quite lesser density which makes it very soft and not suitable for making jewelry pieces. Rather, the 24 Karat gold is much preferred in the use of medical devices for the use of Gold Tympanostomy Tubes.

                                        To note, Tympanostomy Tube is a medical device used on children that suffer ear infections.

                                         22K gold?
                                        Now that you understand the use of 24K gold, you obviously get the need for 22K gold which is of prime importance in crafting your eye-catching jewelries. These are golds carrying a mix of pure gold plus other metals. They carry almost 92 percent of pure gold with the rest being other metals including Zinc, Silver, Nickel, and other alloys.

                                        Comparatively, this form of gold is harder than 24 Karat counterpart. 

                                        An additional note on 18K gold
                                        Unlike either of the above types of gold, in the 18K gold, the percentage of gold is just 75 percent whereas the rest is comprised of copper or silver. Considering its color, it looks a little dull and simple.

                                        How to find the best gold rate in Chennai? Some simple tips:
                                        Now that you have decided to buy gold jewelry for yourself for your loved ones, it is imperative for you to decide on the seller.

                                        How to ensure quality of gold?
                                        There is no point is merely understanding how gold quality is measured. You need to go a step further to reassure the same with hallmarks on the jewelry you buy.
